# ðŸŽ  Gharry

Gharry is a GitHub email notification resender optimized for **my** daily work.

## What I am doing

1. Configure GitHub to send notificaition emails to Slack's muted channel.
2. Run Gharry which scans email notifications via Slack API periodically.
3. Filter, parse and re-send notifications to Slack's unmuted channel.

```
GitHub -[email]-> Slack -[Gharry]-> Slack
```

## Why???

- Implementing my own notifier allows me to customize its behavior completely for my work. For example,
    - I want to unsubscribe some notifications automatically.
    - I want to change a notification level (presence or absense of `@mention`) per notification.
- I wanted to write something in Rust for the first time in a while.

## Implementation

- Do simple polling instead of event driven approach.
    - I don't have a permission to install webhooks to my organization.
    - The GitHub's notifications API cannot be used since it ignores review state changes.
- Do everything in a single thread with blocking. No asynchronous IO.
    - This is enough for this program.
